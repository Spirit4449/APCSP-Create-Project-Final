# Movement Improvements Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Movement Throttling

- **Problem**: Movement data was being sent every frame (60+ times per second), causing excessive network traffic
- **Solution**: Implemented throttling to send movement updates every 75ms (~13 FPS)
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced network bandwidth usage by ~80%
  - More predictable update intervals for smoother interpolation
  - Less server load

### 2. Smooth Movement Tweening for Other Players

- **Problem**: Other players' positions were updated instantly, causing jittery movement
- **Solution**: Implemented Phaser tweens to smoothly interpolate between positions
- **Features**:
  - Linear interpolation over 100ms duration (75ms throttle + 25ms overlap)
  - Smart distance checking - teleports for large distances (>200px) to handle respawns/teleports
  - Automatic cleanup of interrupted tweens
  - Name tags follow smoothly during movement

### 3. Optimized Update Conditions

- **Problem**: Redundant updates were sent even when player wasn't moving meaningfully
- **Solution**: Added intelligent change detection
- **Logic**:
  - Position changes: Only send if moved more than 1 pixel
  - State changes: Flip direction or animation changes
  - Time throttling: Minimum 75ms between updates

### 4. Memory Management

- **Added**: Proper cleanup of movement tweens when players die or disconnect
- **Added**: `destroy()` method to OpPlayer class for proper resource cleanup
- **Benefits**: Prevents memory leaks and orphaned tween objects

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:

1. **game.js**:

   - Added throttling variables and logic
   - Enhanced move event handler with tweening
   - Improved death handling with tween cleanup

2. **opPlayer.js**:
   - Added movementTween property
   - Added destroy() method for cleanup

### Configuration:

- **Throttle Interval**: 75ms (adjustable via `movementThrottleMs`)
- **Tween Duration**: 100ms (throttle + 25ms for smooth overlap)
- **Max Tween Distance**: 200px (larger distances trigger immediate teleport)
- **Position Sensitivity**: 1px minimum change required

## Results

- **Smoother Gameplay**: Other players now move fluidly instead of jumping between positions
- **Reduced Network Traffic**: ~80% reduction in movement-related network messages
- **Better Performance**: Less server and client processing overhead
- **Maintained Responsiveness**: Animations and direction changes still update immediately

## Future Enhancements

- Could implement client-side prediction for even smoother movement
- Could add lag compensation based on ping
- Could implement movement buffering for dropped packets
